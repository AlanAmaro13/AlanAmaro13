# Hi there!

Welcome to my Github profile! Are you interested in Artificial Intelligence applied to Physics?

In this profile I shown a series of applications releated to a wide variety of topics: From automation of process, Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and so on. 

I also present a collection of introduction notebooks to several areas of physics and mathematics, like Linear Algebra, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, etc.

I often code in Python and C++ (ARD), and ocassionaly, in Java.


## ðŸš€ About Me...

I'm Alan Amaro, 22.

I'm a physics student of the Faculty of Science in UNAM. Currently, I'm doing AI investigation in the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence in Exact Sciencs and Engineering [LIACEI] in the Institute of Physics.

I consider myself as an Inventor or Innovator. I primarly motivated by the idea of transforming the world by technology and scientific development. My academic training consists strongly in Physics and their related areas, such as Thermodynamics, Solid State Physics, Quantun Mechanics and Electronic.

I have a good understading in Calculus, Probability, Statistics, Programming.
